[![.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/stevengogogo/ReportTex/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/stevengogogo/ReportTex/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


**ReportTeX** is a LaTeX pipline for generating report and manuscript. This template uses [tectonic](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic) engine to skip cumbersome installation of MacTex (try `brew install tectonic`), and this can largely safe your life! 

This pipline also supports Chinese characters, which is difficult to be render by TeX engine. Fourtunely, tectonic is based on XeTeX which supports `Unit-8` character. Below is the output with the mixture of English and Manderin:
